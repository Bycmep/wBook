    var txt = "<p>Almost every structure we’ve examined so far contributes to forming and storing memories. Memory is therefore a wonderful way to see how different parts of the brain work together on a large scale.</p><p>Soldiers buried more than men in the graves of Southeast Asia. While conquering Singapore in February 1942, Japanese soldiers captured 100,000 mostly British POWs, more than they knew what to do with. The military worked thousands of them to death on the brutal Burma–Siam “Death Railway,” a project that required hacking through 250 miles of mountainous jungles and constructing bridges over rivers like the Kwai. Most of the remaining captives, including many doctors, were crowded into the notorious Japanese prison camps. In fact, two British doctors incarcerated in the Changi camp, Bernard Lennox and Hugh Edward de Wardener, realized that their captors were essentially running a gruesome experiment: taking healthy men, depriving them of one nutrient, and watching their brains deteriorate.</p><p>No matter his background, every doctor in the camps worked as a surgeon, dentist, psychiatrist, and coroner, and they suffered from the same ailments—dysentery, malaria, diphtheria—that ravaged the troops. They pared down bamboo shards for needles, unstitched parachutes for silk sutures, and drained human stomachs for acids. Monsoons tore through their “clinics”—often just tents draped over poles—and some doctors faced beatings and threats of being boiled in oil if they didn’t cure enough soldiers to meet work quotas. Guards made things worse by restricting sick men to half rations, to “motivate” them to recover. But even among the healthy, the food—mostly plain rice—was never adequate, and led to beriberi disease.</p><p>For as long as people have eaten rice in Asia, doctors there have reported outbreaks of beriberi. Symptoms included heart trouble, anorexia, twitching eyes, and legs so swollen that the skin sometimes burst. Victims also walked with a shuffling, staggering gait that reminded locals of <em>beri,</em> sheep. When Europeans colonized Southeast Asia in the 1600s, their doctors began seeing cases as well; one early report came from Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, the Dutchman later immortalized in Rembrandt’s <em>The Anatomy Lesson.</em> But the number of cases exploded after the introduction into Asia, in the later 1800s, of steam-powered rice mills. The mills removed the outer husks from rice grains, producing so-called white rice. People back then called it polished rice, and cheap polished rice became a dietary staple—or, often, <em>the</em> diet—of peasants, soldiers, and prisoners. During the Russo-Japanese War alone, 200,000 Japanese troops fell victim to beriberi.</p><p>Scientists eventually began to suspect that beriberi was a nutritional deficiency—probably a lack of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> (a.k.a. thiamine). In shucking off the nutritious rice husks, the mills stripped out almost all the B<sub>1</sub>, and many people didn’t get enough thiamine from eating vegetables, beans, or meat. Our bodies use B<sub>1</sub> to harvest energy from glucose, the end result of digesting carbohydrates. Brain cells especially rely on glucose for energy, since other sugars cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The brain also needs thiamine to make myelin sheaths and to build certain neurotransmitters.</p><p>A hospital in a Japanese POW camp in Singapore.</p><p>The first cases of beriberi appeared two weeks after the Changi camp opened, among a few alcoholics cut off cold turkey. Many more cases appeared after another month. Doctors tended to the ailing as best they could and sometimes kept their spirits up by lying about the progress of Allied armies. When all else failed, some doctors ordered men to live or face court-martial (a threat reminiscent of those old medieval laws that made suicide illegal). Nevertheless, by June 1942 there were a thousand beriberi cases in Changi alone. Helpless to stop the epidemic, de Wardener and Lennox started doing autopsies in secret and collecting tissues from the brains of beriberi victims, to study the pathology of the disease.</p><p>Although considered contraband, these tissues and autopsy records were mostly safe inside Changi. But in 1943 Lennox and de Wardener were herded off to different camps near the Death Railway in Siam and had to split their medical stash. Wary of confiscation, Lennox arranged to smuggle the brain tissues out of his camp, only to have them perish in a train wreck. De Wardener guarded the all-important paper records, a four-inch sheaf. But as the war turned sour for Japan in early 1945, de Wardener realized that Japanese leaders wouldn’t look kindly on hard evidence of starving POWs. So when he received another transfer order—and saw guards frisking his fellow-transferees and searching their belongings—he made a hasty decision. He had a metallurgist friend seal his papers inside a four-gallon petrol tin. He then wrapped the tin in a cape and buried the bundle three feet deep in a fresh grave, leaving only the dead soldier as a sentinel. To remember which grave it was—there were so many—he and some friends took compass bearings on a few enormous trees nearby. As he departed camp, de Wardener could only pray that the heat, rot, and miasma of Siam wouldn’t eat through the bundle before he returned. If he returned.</p><p>The records were precious because they resolved a half-century-long dispute about the brain, B<sub>1</sub>, and memory. In 1887 a Russian neuroscientist named Sergei Korsakoff described a peculiar ailment among alcoholics. Symptoms included emaciation, staggering, a lack of the patellar kick reflex, and urine “as red as the strongest tea.” But the outstanding symptom was memory loss. Korsakoff’s patients could play chess, banter, make wisecracks, and reason properly—but couldn’t remember the previous day, even the previous hour. During conversations they repeated the same anecdotes over and over, verbatim. And if Korsakoff left the room for a spell, they repeated the same anecdotes over and over, verbatim, when he returned. Other brain diseases cause memory loss, of course, but Korsakoff noticed something distinctive about these cases. If asked a question they can’t answer, most people with memory loss admit they don’t know. Korsakoff’s patients never did—they always lied instead.</p><p>Today, Korsakoff’s syndrome—the tendency to lie compulsively due to brain damage—is a well-recognized ailment. And truth be told, it can be quite entertaining, in a gallows-humor way. When asked why Marie Curie was famous, one Korsakoff victim declared, “Because of her hairstyle.” Another claimed to know Charlemagne’s favorite meal (“maize porridge”) and what color horse King Arthur rode (“black”). Victims lie especially often about their personal lives. One man claimed to remember, thirty years later, what he wore the first day of summer in 1979. Another told his doctor, in consecutive sentences, that he’d been married for four months and that he’d sired four children with his wife. After a quick calculation, he marveled at his sexual prowess: “Not bad.”</p><p>Beyond the occasional Münchhausenian whopper, most Korsakoff victims tell plausible, even mundane lies: unless you knew their life histories, you’d never peg them as bullshit artists. Unlike most of us, they don’t lie to make themselves look good, or to get an edge, or to conceal something. And unlike people suffering from delusions, they don’t defend themselves ferociously if called out; many just shrug. But no matter how many times someone catches them, they keep lying. This fibbing for no obvious or underhanded reason is known as confabulation.</p><p>Korsakoff focused on the psychology of confabulation, but other scientists extended his work in the early 1900s and started linking these psychological symptoms to specific brain damage. In particular, they discovered tiny hemorrhages in the brains of victims, as well as patches of dead neurons. Pathologists also linked Korsakoff’s syndrome to another, related disease called Wernicke’s syndrome. In fact, because Wernicke’s syndrome often turns into Korsakoff’s, the two were eventually yoked together as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.</p><p>The underlying cause of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome took longer to suss out, but by the later 1930s a few scientists had linked it to a lack of B<sub>1</sub>. As doctors now know, alcohol prevents the intestines from absorbing the thiamine in food. This shortage then causes changes inside the brain, especially to glial cells. Among other jobs, glial cells sponge up excess neurotransmitters from the synapses between neurons. And without thiamine, the glia cannot sop up glutamate, which stimulates neurons. As a result of this excess, neurons get overstimulated and eventually exhaust themselves, dying of excitotoxicity.</p><p>Because they seemed to share a common root—B<sub>1</sub> deficiency—beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome should have caused similar symptoms and similar destruction inside the brain. But through the 1940s no one had any hard evidence to link them. This was partly because Wernicke-Korsakoff remained rare and associated primarily with alcoholics, and partly because doctors who studied beriberi focused on nerve and heart damage, not brain damage. The net result was confusion: was this one disease or two? More important, it highlighted a growing concern over efforts to link physiology and psychology: many doctors frankly doubted that the lack of a simple vitamin—a molecular problem—could leap up so many levels of scale and cause complex mental troubles like confabulation.</p>";
