<h1>CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<p>Almost every structure we’ve examined so far contributes to forming and storing memories. Memory is therefore a wonderful way to see how different parts of the brain work together on a large scale.</p><p>Soldiers buried more than men in the graves of Southeast Asia. While conquering Singapore in February 1942, Japanese soldiers captured 100,000 mostly British POWs, more than they knew what to do with. The military worked thousands of them to death on the brutal Burma–Siam “Death Railway,” a project that required hacking through 250 miles of mountainous jungles and constructing bridges over rivers like the Kwai. Most of the remaining captives, including many doctors, were crowded into the notorious Japanese prison camps. In fact, two British doctors incarcerated in the Changi camp, Bernard Lennox and Hugh Edward de Wardener, realized that their captors were essentially running a gruesome experiment: taking healthy men, depriving them of one nutrient, and watching their brains deteriorate.</p><p>No matter his background, every doctor in the camps worked as a surgeon, dentist, psychiatrist, and coroner, and they suffered from the same ailments—dysentery, malaria, diphtheria—that ravaged the troops. They pared down bamboo shards for needles, unstitched parachutes for silk sutures, and drained human stomachs for acids. Monsoons tore through their “clinics”—often just tents draped over poles—and some doctors faced beatings and threats of being boiled in oil if they didn’t cure enough soldiers to meet work quotas. Guards made things worse by restricting sick men to half rations, to “motivate” them to recover. But even among the healthy, the food—mostly plain rice—was never adequate, and led to beriberi disease.</p><p>For as long as people have eaten rice in Asia, doctors there have reported outbreaks of beriberi. Symptoms included heart trouble, anorexia, twitching eyes, and legs so swollen that the skin sometimes burst. Victims also walked with a shuffling, staggering gait that reminded locals of <em>beri,</em> sheep. When Europeans colonized Southeast Asia in the 1600s, their doctors began seeing cases as well; one early report came from Dr. Nicolaes Tulp, the Dutchman later immortalized in Rembrandt’s <em>The Anatomy Lesson.</em> But the number of cases exploded after the introduction into Asia, in the later 1800s, of steam-powered rice mills. The mills removed the outer husks from rice grains, producing so-called white rice. People back then called it polished rice, and cheap polished rice became a dietary staple—or, often, <em>the</em> diet—of peasants, soldiers, and prisoners. During the Russo-Japanese War alone, 200,000 Japanese troops fell victim to beriberi.</p><p>Scientists eventually began to suspect that beriberi was a nutritional deficiency—probably a lack of vitamin B<sub>1</sub> (a.k.a. thiamine). In shucking off the nutritious rice husks, the mills stripped out almost all the B<sub>1</sub>, and many people didn’t get enough thiamine from eating vegetables, beans, or meat. Our bodies use B<sub>1</sub> to harvest energy from glucose, the end result of digesting carbohydrates. Brain cells especially rely on glucose for energy, since other sugars cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. The brain also needs thiamine to make myelin sheaths and to build certain neurotransmitters.</p><p>A hospital in a Japanese POW camp in Singapore.</p><p>The first cases of beriberi appeared two weeks after the Changi camp opened, among a few alcoholics cut off cold turkey. Many more cases appeared after another month. Doctors tended to the ailing as best they could and sometimes kept their spirits up by lying about the progress of Allied armies. When all else failed, some doctors ordered men to live or face court-martial (a threat reminiscent of those old medieval laws that made suicide illegal). Nevertheless, by June 1942 there were a thousand beriberi cases in Changi alone. Helpless to stop the epidemic, de Wardener and Lennox started doing autopsies in secret and collecting tissues from the brains of beriberi victims, to study the pathology of the disease.</p><p>Although considered contraband, these tissues and autopsy records were mostly safe inside Changi. But in 1943 Lennox and de Wardener were herded off to different camps near the Death Railway in Siam and had to split their medical stash. Wary of confiscation, Lennox arranged to smuggle the brain tissues out of his camp, only to have them perish in a train wreck. De Wardener guarded the all-important paper records, a four-inch sheaf. But as the war turned sour for Japan in early 1945, de Wardener realized that Japanese leaders wouldn’t look kindly on hard evidence of starving POWs. So when he received another transfer order—and saw guards frisking his fellow-transferees and searching their belongings—he made a hasty decision. He had a metallurgist friend seal his papers inside a four-gallon petrol tin. He then wrapped the tin in a cape and buried the bundle three feet deep in a fresh grave, leaving only the dead soldier as a sentinel. To remember which grave it was—there were so many—he and some friends took compass bearings on a few enormous trees nearby. As he departed camp, de Wardener could only pray that the heat, rot, and miasma of Siam wouldn’t eat through the bundle before he returned. If he returned.</p><p>The records were precious because they resolved a half-century-long dispute about the brain, B<sub>1</sub>, and memory. In 1887 a Russian neuroscientist named Sergei Korsakoff described a peculiar ailment among alcoholics. Symptoms included emaciation, staggering, a lack of the patellar kick reflex, and urine “as red as the strongest tea.” But the outstanding symptom was memory loss. Korsakoff’s patients could play chess, banter, make wisecracks, and reason properly—but couldn’t remember the previous day, even the previous hour. During conversations they repeated the same anecdotes over and over, verbatim. And if Korsakoff left the room for a spell, they repeated the same anecdotes over and over, verbatim, when he returned. Other brain diseases cause memory loss, of course, but Korsakoff noticed something distinctive about these cases. If asked a question they can’t answer, most people with memory loss admit they don’t know. Korsakoff’s patients never did—they always lied instead.</p><p>Today, Korsakoff’s syndrome—the tendency to lie compulsively due to brain damage—is a well-recognized ailment. And truth be told, it can be quite entertaining, in a gallows-humor way. When asked why Marie Curie was famous, one Korsakoff victim declared, “Because of her hairstyle.” Another claimed to know Charlemagne’s favorite meal (“maize porridge”) and what color horse King Arthur rode (“black”). Victims lie especially often about their personal lives. One man claimed to remember, thirty years later, what he wore the first day of summer in 1979. Another told his doctor, in consecutive sentences, that he’d been married for four months and that he’d sired four children with his wife. After a quick calculation, he marveled at his sexual prowess: “Not bad.”</p><p>Beyond the occasional Münchhausenian whopper, most Korsakoff victims tell plausible, even mundane lies: unless you knew their life histories, you’d never peg them as bullshit artists. Unlike most of us, they don’t lie to make themselves look good, or to get an edge, or to conceal something. And unlike people suffering from delusions, they don’t defend themselves ferociously if called out; many just shrug. But no matter how many times someone catches them, they keep lying. This fibbing for no obvious or underhanded reason is known as confabulation.</p><p>Korsakoff focused on the psychology of confabulation, but other scientists extended his work in the early 1900s and started linking these psychological symptoms to specific brain damage. In particular, they discovered tiny hemorrhages in the brains of victims, as well as patches of dead neurons. Pathologists also linked Korsakoff’s syndrome to another, related disease called Wernicke’s syndrome. In fact, because Wernicke’s syndrome often turns into Korsakoff’s, the two were eventually yoked together as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.</p><p>The underlying cause of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome took longer to suss out, but by the later 1930s a few scientists had linked it to a lack of B<sub>1</sub>. As doctors now know, alcohol prevents the intestines from absorbing the thiamine in food. This shortage then causes changes inside the brain, especially to glial cells. Among other jobs, glial cells sponge up excess neurotransmitters from the synapses between neurons. And without thiamine, the glia cannot sop up glutamate, which stimulates neurons. As a result of this excess, neurons get overstimulated and eventually exhaust themselves, dying of excitotoxicity.</p><p>Because they seemed to share a common root—B<sub>1</sub> deficiency—beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome should have caused similar symptoms and similar destruction inside the brain. But through the 1940s no one had any hard evidence to link them. This was partly because Wernicke-Korsakoff remained rare and associated primarily with alcoholics, and partly because doctors who studied beriberi focused on nerve and heart damage, not brain damage. The net result was confusion: was this one disease or two? More important, it highlighted a growing concern over efforts to link physiology and psychology: many doctors frankly doubted that the lack of a simple vitamin—a molecular problem—could leap up so many levels of scale and cause complex mental troubles like confabulation.</p>
<p>Changi proved it could. Among the thousand-plus beriberi victims there, several dozen also came down with symptoms of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, including confabulation. As an example, de Wardener asked one far-gone man, just to test his mental state, “Do you remember when we met in Brighton? I was riding a white horse and you a black horse, and we rode on the beach.” This was bunk, but the man answered that of course he remembered, and filled in the details. Such imaginings often became the patients’ reality, sadly, and a few men died in this state—their last “memories” nothing but vapors and fabrications. Medically, the fact that beriberi always preceded Wernicke-Korsakoff, and that those with the worst beriberi got the worst Wernicke-Korsakoff, implied a common cause. Autopsies then cemented the link: even without a microscope, Lennox, a trained pathologist, could see the characteristic hemorrhages and patches of dead neurons in the brains of victims. Beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff seemed to be two stages, chronic and acute, of the same underlying disease.</p>
<p>As further evidence, treating victims with pure thiamine (some doctors had tiny stashes) usually relieved the symptoms of both Wernicke-Korsakoff and beriberi, sometimes within hours: de Wardener remembers a few men roaring to life and consuming whole mountains of rice to combat their sudden hunger. (Mental symptoms such as confabulation might take several weeks to dissipate.) For less acute cases doctors might add Marmite to meals (however unappetizing, this yeast-based extract is lousy with B<sub>1</sub>) or ferment rice and potatoes to cultivate wild yeast, also chock-full of B<sub>1</sub>. Some doctors sent men to gather thiamine-rich hibiscus leaves as well. The smarter doctors lied to the men and claimed that hibiscus would pump up their libidos for when they got back home to their gals. After that, troops no doubt couldn’t consume enough hibiscus.</p>
<p>In tandem, the fact that consuming too little thiamine provoked Wernicke-Korsakoff, and that restoring thiamine to the diet relieved it, convinced Lennox and de Wardener that the lack of a simple nutrient could indeed destroy something as profound as our memories, even our sense of truth. But the duo still had to make their case to the medical world—which meant not only surviving the camps but preserving their autopsy files. This wasn’t easy in a war zone, and as de Wardener discovered, about the only way to conceal such things was to bury them, and pray to God they survived.</p>
<p>After V-J Day, de Wardener received mysterious orders to report to Bangkok. Although anxious to start searching for his files, he remembers enjoying the journey: “I took a victorious ride across Siam in a Jeep, with all the Nips bowing… which was very satisfying.” To his surprise, he found his records waiting for him at Bangkok HQ. Apparently a friend had returned to Changi with a shovel not long before, scrabbled through the dirt above the dead sentinel’s body, and liberated the bundle. It was a close thing: the cape had rotted away and the solder sealing up the tin had disintegrated. But the papers had survived, perhaps by a matter of days. Lennox and de Wardener finally published this, well, groundbreaking work in 1947.<b href="endnotes.xhtml#en0052" id="en0052a"><sup>*</sup></b></p>
<p class="space-break">Since World War II, neuroscientists have continued to mine confabulation for insight into how memory works, and it has proved a rich vein indeed. For example, confabulations reveal that each memory seems to have a distinct time stamp, like a computer file. And just like computer files, that time stamp can be corrupted. Most confabulators tell plausible lies; in fact, many of their false “memories” did happen to them at some point. But confabulators often mistake <em>when</em> the memory happened: the scenes in their lives have been shuffled wrong. So while they claim they ate truffled duck last night, in truth they did that thirty years ago while honeymooning in Paris. In some sense, then, confabulation is a breakdown in the ability to tell a coherent story about our lives.</p>
<p>The fact that virtually all confabulators have frontal lobe damage also tells us something. The frontal lobes help coordinate multistep processes, and despite how effortless memory seems, remembering something specific (say, the worst Christmas present you ever got) is complicated. The brain has a fraction of a second to search for the memory, retrieve it, replay it, and summon up the proper sensations and emotions—and that’s assuming you recorded the memory accurately in the first place. If the frontal lobes suffer damage, any one of those steps can go awry. Perhaps confabulators simply retrieve the wrong memory each time they “recall” something, and don’t recognize their error.</p>
<p>Some scientists trace confabulations to shame and a need to cover up deficiencies. Confabulators don’t generally blurt things out unprovoked; you have to ask questions to elicit the lie. And according to this theory, admitting they don’t know something upsets and embarrasses people, so they pretend. For example, most doctors ask at intake how many children someone has. Having to admit “I don’t know” could be catastrophic to a person’s well-being, since what kind of monster doesn’t remember his own children? In short, confabulations could be a defense mechanism, a way for people to hide their brain damage, even from themselves.</p>
<p>As another defense mechanism, some confabulators invent fictional characters and foist their personal failings onto them. One alcoholic confabulator raved to his doctor about imps who kept breaking into his apartment, even after he changed the locks, and stealing things like his remote control. He eventually heaved the imps outdoors on a brutal January night. But, feeling guilty, he braved the weather and draped clothes over them later that night, then called an ambulance. In reality medical workers had discovered <em>him</em> outside that winter, stone drunk and mostly naked. In telling the story he was basically confabulating an allegory on the fly. That’s a remarkable deed for someone with brain damage, and the ruse allowed him to ponder his own flaws more objectively, without implicating himself.</p>
<p>As that last case shows, it’s not always clear whether confabulators understand that they’re lying. Most seem blithely unaware, and many neuroscientists insist that Korsakoff patients don’t realize what’s happening. But is that possible? Covering up a memory gap, even subconsciously, implies that they know on some level that the gap exists. Which means they know and don’t know at the same time. It’s a doozy of a conundrum, and it raises all sorts of stoner questions about whether you can truly deceive yourself, and more broadly about the nature of truth and falsehood. Consider asking a confabulator what she ate for breakfast. If she hasn’t the foggiest, she might blurt, “Leftover pizza.” But of course it’s possible she did have cold pizza for breakfast, in which case she would be telling the truth—even though her brain tried, consciously or not, to put one over on you. What on earth would you call that? Neither <em>lying</em> nor <em>telling the truth</em> quite encompasses it. It’s slipperier, and some neuroscientists have taken to calling it “honest lying.”</p>
<p>Philosophical conundrums aside, work on confabulation helped make memory a proper object of neuroscientific study last century, since scientists could finally link memory to the brain and its biology. That said, the biggest breakthrough in memory research in the past hundred years didn’t spring from the minds of confabulators. Indeed, most memory work until the 1950s relied on a flawed assumption—that all parts of the brain contribute equally to forming and storing memories. It’s an idea that took something drastic, a botched operation by a lobotomist, to overturn.</p>
<p class="space-break">In the early 1930s a bicyclist in Connecticut struck a small boy, who tumbled and cracked his skull. No one knows whether the accident alone caused his epilepsy—three cousins had it, so he might have been predisposed—but the blow probably precipitated it, and at age ten he started having seizures. Each lasted around forty seconds, during which time his mouth flopped open, his eyes slipped shut, and his arms and legs crossed and uncrossed as if curled by an invisible puppeteer. He suffered his first grand mal on, of all days, his fifteenth birthday, while riding in the car with his parents. More followed, in class and at home and while shopping—up to ten seizures a day, with at least one major episode per week. So at an age when most people are struggling to find an identity, he was saddled with one he didn’t want: the kid who shook, who bit his tongue, who slumped over and blacked out and pissed himself. The mockery got so bad he dropped out of high school, and he earned his diploma only at twenty-one, from a different school. He ended up living at home and working in a motor shop.</p>
<p>Finally the desperate young man—soon immortalized as H.M.—decided to try surgery. When younger, H.M. had dreamed of practicing neurosurgery himself and studying how the brain works. But while H.M. did end up contributing, profoundly, to neuroscience, his affliction ensured that he would never grasp his own importance.</p>
<p>H.M. started seeing Dr. William Scoville around 1943. A noted daredevil—before a medical conference in Spain once, he’d stripped off his jacket and mixed it up with the <em>toros</em> in the bullring—Scoville liked risky surgeries, too, and had jumped onto the American lobotomy bandwagon<b href="endnotes.xhtml#en0053" id="en0053a"><sup>*</sup></b> early. But he disliked the drastic changes in his patients’ personalities, so he began experimenting with “fractional” lobotomies, which destroyed less tissue. Over the years he basically worked his way around the brain, carving out this piece or that and checking the results, until he finally reached the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Because it was part of the limbic system, scientists at the time believed that the hippocampus helped process emotions, but its exact function remained unknown. Rabies often destroyed it, and James Papez had singled it out for attention. (A poetaster, Papez even penned a ditty to his wife that read: “It’s Pearl, my girl on Broad Street that I miss… My hippocampus tells me this.”) Scoville was less enamored: he’d seen the mental turmoil that hippocampus damage could cause. So in the early 1950s he started removing the hippocampi (you have one in each hemisphere) from a few psychotics. Although it was hard to be sure in people with such disturbed minds, they seemed to suffer no ill effects, and two women in particular showed a marked reduction in seizures. Unfortunately Scoville neglected to do careful follow-up tests until November 1953—after he’d convinced H.M. to try the surgery.</p>
<p>H.M.’s operation took place in Hartford, Connecticut, on September 1, 1953. Scoville peeled back his patient’s scalp, then used a hand crank and one-dollar drill saw from a local hardware store to remove a bottle cap’s worth of bone from above each eye. As cerebrospinal fluid drained away, the brain settled down in its cavity, giving Scoville more room to work. With what looked like an elongated shoehorn, he nudged aside H.M.’s frontal and temporal lobes and peered inside.</p>
<p>The hippocampus sits at ear level and has the rough shape and diameter of a curled thumb. Hoping to remove as little tissue as possible, Scoville first sparked each hippocampus with wires to find the origin of H.M.’s seizures. No luck, so he grabbed a long metal tube and began cutting and sucking out tissue gram by gram; he eventually removed three inches’ worth of hippocampus on each side. (Two nubs of hippocampal tissue remained behind, but because Scoville also removed the connections between those nubs and other parts of the brain, the nubs were useless, like unplugged computers.) For good measure, Scoville removed H.M.’s amygdalae and other nearby structures as well. Given how deeply all these structures are embedded in the brain, only a neurosurgeon could have destroyed them with such precision.</p>
<p>Post-op, H.M. remained drowsy for a few days, but he could recognize his family and carry on a seemingly normal conversation. And by many measures, the operation succeeded. His personality never changed; the seizures all but disappeared (two attacks per year at most); and when the fog of epilepsy lifted, his IQ jumped from 104 to 117. Just one problem: his memory was shot. Aside from a few small islands of recollection—like the fact that Dr. Scoville had operated on him—an entire decade’s worth of memories from before the surgery had vanished. Equally terrible, he couldn’t form new memories. Names escaped him now, as did the day of the week. He repeated the same comments over and over, verbatim, and while he might remember directions to the bathroom long enough to get there, he always had to ask again later. He’d even consume multiple lunches or breakfasts if no one stopped him, as if his appetite had no memory, either. His mind had become a sieve.</p>
<p>In light of modern knowledge, H.M.’s deficit makes sense. Memory formation involves several steps. First, neurons in the cortex jot down what our sensory neurons see and feel and hear. This ability to record first impressions still worked in H.M. But like messages scrawled on the beach, these impressions erode quickly. It’s the next step, involving neurons in the hippocampus, that makes memories last. These neurons produce special proteins that encourage axon bulbs to swell in size. As a result, the axons can stream more neurotransmitter bubbles toward their neighbors. This in turn strengthens the synapse connections between those neurons before the memory decays. Over months and years—provided the first impression was strong enough, or we think about the event from time to time—the hippocampus then transfers the memory to the cortex for permanent storage. In short, the hippocampus orchestrates both the recording and the storage of memories, and without it, this “memory consolidation” cannot occur.</p>
<p>Scoville couldn’t have known all this, but he’d clearly sabotaged H.M.’s memory, and he didn’t know what to do. So a few months later, when he saw that Wilder Penfield was about to publish a report on hippocampus damage, Scoville called the renowned surgeon and confessed.</p>
<p>Penfield had recently operated on two patients with hippocampal epilepsy. To be safe, he’d removed the structure on just one side, but unbeknownst to him, the seizures had already destroyed the other hippocampus in each person. So removing the one left both patients without a working hippocampus, and they developed the purest amnesia Penfield had ever seen. Although he was still puzzling through the cases, a graduate student was going to present them at a scientific meeting in Chicago in 1954.</p>
<p>When Scoville called, Penfield reportedly flipped out, berating him for his recklessness. After calming down, though, the scientist in Penfield realized (much as the beriberi doctors had) that Scoville had actually performed an invaluable experiment: here was a chance to determine what the hippocampus did. As part of its mission Penfield’s clinic in Montreal tracked the psychological changes that patients experienced after psychosurgery. So Penfield dispatched a Ph.D. student from the Neuro, Brenda Milner, down to Connecticut to investigate the hippocampusless H.M.</p>
<p>After his memory vanished, H.M. lost his job and had no choice but to keep living with his parents. He spoke in a monotone now and had no interest in sex, but otherwise seemed normal. To the neighbors, it probably just looked like he was loafing his life away. He took a part-time job packing rubber balloons into plastic bags, and did odd chores around the house. (Although his parents had to remind him where they kept the lawn mower every single time, he could actually mow just fine, since he could see what grass he hadn’t cut.) His temper did flare up occasionally: his mother tended to nag, and he cuffed her a few times and kicked her shins. Another time, when an uncle removed a few choice rifles from the family’s gun collection, he flew into a rage. (Despite his amnesia he retained a lifelong love of guns, and always remembered to renew his NRA membership.) But he whiled away most days peacefully, either doing crossword puzzles—working through the clues methodically, in order—or flopping in front of the television and watching either Sunday Mass or the old movies that, to him, would never become classics. It was like early retirement, except for the days Milner arrived to test him.</p>
<p>Milner would take the night train down from Montreal to Hartford, arriving at 3 a.m. and spending the next few days with H.M. Her battery of tests confirmed Scoville’s basic observations pretty quickly: H.M. had little memory of the past and no ability to form new memories going forward. This was already a big advance—proof that some parts of the brain, namely the hippocampus, contribute more to forming and storing memories than other parts. And what Milner discovered next redefined what “memory” even meant.</p>
<p>Rather than keep asking him questions he couldn’t answer, she started testing H.M.’s motor skills. Most important, she gave him a piece of paper with two five-pointed stars on it, one nested inside the other: . The outer star was about six inches wide, and there was a half-inch or so gap between them. The test required H.M. to trace a third star between the two with a pencil. The catch was, he couldn’t see the stars directly: Milner had shielded the diagram, and he had to look at them in a mirror instead. Left was right, right was left, and every natural instinct about where to move his pencil was wrong. Anyone taking this mirror test for the first time makes a mess—the pencil line looks like an EKG—and H.M. proved no exception. Somehow, though, H.M. got better. He didn’t remember any of the thirty training sessions Milner ran him through. But his unconscious motor centers did remember, and after three days he could trace the star in the mirror fluently. He even commented near the end, “This is funny… I would have thought it would be rather difficult, but it seems I’ve done pretty well.”</p>
<p>Milner remembers the star test as a eureka. Before this, neuroscientists thought of memory as monolithic: the brain stored memories all over, and all memory was essentially the same. But Milner had now teased apart two distinct types of memory. There’s declarative memory, which allows people to remember names, dates, facts; this is what most of us mean by “memory.” But there’s also procedural memory—unconscious memories of how to pedal a bicycle or sign your name. Tracing the stars proved that H.M., despite his amnesia, could form new procedural memories. Procedural memories must therefore rely on distinct structures within the brain.</p>
<p>This distinction between procedural and declarative memories (sometimes called “knowing how” versus “knowing that”) now undergirds all memory research. It also sheds light on basic mental development. Infants develop procedural memory early, which explains why they can walk and talk fairly quickly. Declarative memory develops later, and its initial weakness prevents us from remembering much from early childhood.</p>
<p>Another distinct type of memory emerged from Milner’s tests as well. One day Milner asked H.M. to remember a random number, 584, for as long as possible. She then left him alone for fifteen minutes while she had a cup of coffee. Contrary to her expectation, he still knew the number when she returned. How? He’d been repeating it under his breath, over and over. Similarly, H.M. could remember the words “nail” and “salad” for several minutes by imagining a nail piercing some salad greens and reminding himself over and over not to eat the impaled leaves. Any distraction during those minutes would have ejected the words clean out of H.M.’s mind, and five minutes after the test ended, even the memory of having to remember something had vanished. Nevertheless, as long as H.M. concentrated and kept refreshing his memory, he could hold on. This was the first clue that short-term memory exists; moreover, it showed that short-term memory (which H.M. had) and long-term memory (which he lacked) must utilize different brain structures.</p>
<p>After Milner’s discoveries, H.M. became a scientific celebrity, and other neuroscientists began clamoring to explore his unique mind. He did not disappoint. In April 1958, five years after the operation, H.M. and his parents moved into a small Hartford bungalow. In 1966 a few American neuroscientists asked him to draw the home’s floor plan from memory. He succeeded. He didn’t know the bungalow’s address, but walking through its six rooms over and over had tattooed the layout into his brain. This proved that our spatial memory systems, while normally reliant on the hippocampus, can circumvent it if need be (probably via the parahippocampus, a nearby navigation center).</p>
<p>Scientists also discovered that time worked differently for H.M. Up to about twenty seconds, he reckoned time as accurately as any normal person. After that, things veered wildly. Five minutes lasted, subjectively, just forty seconds for him; one hour lasted three minutes; one day fifteen minutes. This implies that the brain uses two different timekeepers—one for the short term and one for everything beyond twenty seconds, with only the latter suffering damage in H.M. Once again, H.M. allowed scientists to break a complex mental function down into different components and to link those components to structures in the brain. Eventually more than one hundred neuroscientists examined H.M., making his probably the most studied mind in history.</p>
<p>All the while H.M. got older, at least physically. Mentally, he remained stuck in the 1940s. He remembered not a single birthday or funeral after that time; the Cold War and sexual revolution never registered; new words such as <em>granola</em> and <em>Jacuzzi</em> remained forever undefined. Worse, a vague sense of uneasiness often bubbled up inside him, and he could never quite shake it. The feeling, Milner reported, was “like that fraction of a second in the morning, when you are in a strange hotel room, before it all falls in[to] place.” Only for H.M. it never did.</p>
<p>In 1980, after H.M.’s father died and his mother got too sick to care for him, he moved into a nursing home. He walked a little gimpily by that point: years of taking heavy-duty epilepsy drugs had withered his cerebellum, and his wide, shuffling gait resembled that of kuru victims. He also got pretty portly after too many forgotten second helpings of cake and pudding. But overall he was a fairly normal patient and lived a (mostly) placid life. He loafed through the nontesting days reading poems or gun magazines, watching trains rumble by, and petting the dogs, cats, and rabbits the facility owned. He learned how to use a walker, thanks to his intact motor memories, and he even attended his thirty-fifth high school reunion in 1982. (Although he recognized no one there, other attendees reported the same problem.) When he dreamed at night, he often dreamed of hills—not of struggling up them, but cresting them and being at the top.</p>
<p>Still, the old, volatile H.M. did flare up now and again. He sometimes refused to take his meds—at which point his nurses scolded him, warning him that Dr. Scoville would get angry if he disobeyed. (That Scoville had died in a car crash didn’t matter. H.M. always fell for it.) He got into fights with other residents as well. One harpy at the nursing home would erase his bingo card midgame and taunt him. H.M. sometimes responded by running to his room and either banging his head on the wall or grabbing his bed and shaking it like a gorilla would its cage. One fit got so violent that his nurses called the police. These were moments of pure animal frustration—and yet in some ways they seem like his most human moments. For a few seconds a real person broke through the dull, bovine exterior. He was reacting the way we’d all want to if dealt his fate: he raged.</p>
<p>As soon as a nurse distracted H.M., he forgot his torment, of course. And aside from those flare-ups he lived a quiet life, albeit in declining health. He finally died in 2008, aged eighty-two, of respiratory failure—at which point scientists revealed him to the world as Henry Gustav Molaison.</p>
<p>The world of neuroscience mourned Molaison: his death led to numerous tributes about his patience and kindness, as well as scores of puns about his being unforgettable. And his brain is still providing insight today. Before his death, his nursing home had started stockpiling ice packs in preparation; when he passed, employees ringed his skull with them to keep his brain cool. Doctors soon arrived to claim the body, and that night they scanned his brain in situ and then liberated it. After two months hardening in formalin, it was flown cross-country in a cooler (which got the window seat) to a brain institute in San Diego. Scientists there soaked it in sugar solutions to draw out excess water, then froze it to solidify it. Finally, they used the medical equivalent of a deli slicer to shave Molaison’s brain into 2,401 slices, each of which they mounted on a glass plate and photographed at 20x magnification, to form a digital, zoomable map down to the level of individual neurons. The slicing process was broadcast live online, and 400,000 people tuned in to say goodbye to H.M.</p>
<p class="space-break">Although H.M. dominated the scientific literature and popular imagination, plenty of other amnesiacs have contributed to our understanding of memory. Take K.C., an amnesiac in suburban Toronto. During a wild and extended adolescence, K.C. jammed in rock bands, partied at Mardi Gras, played cards till all hours, and got into fights in bars; he was also knocked unconscious twice, once in a dune buggy accident, once when a bale of hay konked him. Finally, in October 1981, at age thirty, he skidded off an exit ramp on his motorcycle. He spent a month in intensive care and lost, among other structures, both hippocampi.</p>
<p>After the accident a neuroscientist named Endel Tulving determined that K.C. could remember certain things just fine. But everything he remembered fell within one restricted category: it was all stuff you could look up in reference books, like the difference between stalactites and stalagmites or between spares and strikes in bowling. Tulving called these bare facts “semantic memories,” memories devoid of all context and emotion.</p>
<p>At the same time K.C. had zero “episodic memory”—no memories of things he’d personally done or felt or seen. For instance, in 1979 K.C. surprised his family the night before his brother’s wedding by getting a perm. To this day he knows his brother got married and can recognize family members in the wedding album (the facts), but he doesn’t remember being at the wedding and has no idea how his family reacted to his curly hair (the personal experiences). The little that K.C. did retain about his preaccident life sounds like something he looked up in a particularly dry biography of himself. Even pivotal moments have been reduced to bulleted points in an index. He knows his family had to abandon his childhood home because a train derailed and spilled toxic chemicals nearby; he knows a beloved brother died two years before his own accident. But these events have no emotional import anymore. They’re just stuff that happened.</p>
<p>These details, along with scans of K.C.’s brain, provided strong evidence that our episodic and semantic memories rely on different brain circuits. The hippocampus helps record both types of memories initially, and it helps retain them for the medium term. The hippocampus probably also helps us access old <em>personal</em> memories in long-term storage. But to access old semantic memories, the brain seems to use the parahippocampus, an extension of the hippocampus on the brain’s southernmost surface. K.C., whose parahippocampi survived, could therefore remember to sink the eight ball last in pool (semantic knowledge), even though every last memory of playing pool with his buddies had disappeared (personal knowledge).</p>
<p>What’s more, while a healthy hippocampus will usually take responsibility for recording new semantic memories, the parahippocampus can—albeit excruciatingly slowly—absorb new facts if it has to. For instance, after years of shelving books as a volunteer at a local library, K.C.’s parahippocampus learned the Dewey decimal system, even though he had no idea why he knew it. Similarly, H.M.’s healthy parahippocampus picked up a few choice facts after his 1953 surgery. After seeing the crossword clue a thousand times he dimly recalled that “Salk vaccine target” equaled P-O-L-I-O. And through incessant references, he retained a sliver of information about the 1969 moon landing and 1963 Kennedy assassination. Contra the cliché, he couldn’t recall where he was when he learned those things—that’s episodic memory. And his knowledge of the events remained weak and fragmentary, since the parahippocampus cannot learn very well. He nevertheless absorbed that they’d happened.</p>
<p>Along these same lines, K.C. helped neuroscience come to grips with another important distinction in memory research, between recollection and familiarity. Colloquially, recollection means <em>I specifically remember this,</em> while familiarity means <em>this sounds familiar, even if the details are fuzzy.</em> And sure enough, the brain makes the same distinction. In one test K.C.’s doctors compiled a list of words (El Niño, posse) that entered the common parlance after his accident in 1981. They then sprinkled those words into a list of pseudo-words—strings of letters that looked like plausible words but that meant nothing. Time and again K.C. picked out the real word, and did so with confidence. But when asked to define the word, he shrugged. From a list of common names he picked out the people who’d become famous after 1981 (e.g., Bill Clinton). But he had no inkling what Clinton had done. In other words, K.C. found these terms familiar, even though specific recollection eluded him. This indicates that recollection once again requires the hippocampus, while a feeling of familiarity requires only certain patches of cortex.</p>
<p>A final type of memory that amnesiacs have helped illuminate is emotional memory—which makes sense, given that the hippocampus belongs to the limbic system. Possibly because he had no amygdalae, H.M. was always pretty affable around the scientists who visited him, despite never recognizing them. (Not even Milner, who worked with him for a half century.) Other amnesiacs lacked his easygoing manner, though, and a few got outright snarly. In 1992 herpes simplex—the same bug that knocked out people’s ability to recognize fruits, animals, and tools—hollowed out the hippocampi and other structures inside the brain of a seventy-year-old San Diego man named E.P. He started repeating the same anecdotes over and over, verbatim, and eating up to three breakfasts each day. And despite being a former sailor who lived less than two miles from the coast, he suddenly couldn’t remember even the general direction of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Doctors arranged to test E.P., but he grew suspicious of the “strangers”—really the same woman each time—invading his home. Every visit, he dug in his heels, and every visit, his wife had to talk him into playing nice and drag him to the kitchen table to start testing. Eventually, though, after more than a hundred visits, E.P. let his guard down. He started greeting the tester warmly, despite maintaining that he’d never seen her; he even started moving toward the kitchen table on his own to start testing. Somehow, even though his mind was telling him otherwise, his emotions remembered to trust his tester. Amnesiacs can retain negative emotional memories, too. When H.M. learned that his father had died, his conscious brain of course forgot that fact within minutes. But his emotional brain remembered, and took the news so hard that he plunged into a months-long funk, even though he couldn’t explain why he felt so low. In another example, from around 1911, a Swiss doctor named Édouard Claparède concealed a pin between his fingers before greeting a middle-aged amnesic woman; when they shook hands, he pricked her. Although she remembered nothing of this, she always withdrew her hand, and eyed him, on subsequent meetings.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this alphabetic soup of amnesiacs (q.v., e.g., H.M., K.C., E.P.) helped scientists sort out how the brain divides up responsibility for memories. Nondeclarative memories (like motor memories) rely on the cerebellum and on certain internal clusters of gray matter such as the striatum. Episodic (personal) memories lean heavily on the hippocampus, while semantic (factual) memories utilize the parahippocampus to a much larger degree, especially for retrieval. The frontal lobes contribute as well, both in searching for memories and in double-checking that the brain has grabbed the right memory from long-term storage in the cortex. Sensory and limbic circuits also kick on to reanimate the moment in our minds. Meanwhile, the parietal and frontal lobes whisper to us that we’re reviewing old information, so we don’t get terrified or amorous all over again. Each step works independently, and each one can malfunction without affecting other mental faculties in the slightest.</p>
<p>That’s the theory, at least. In reality it seems impossible to tear out any one aspect of memory—especially our episodic memories, memories of holidays and lovers and times we fell short—without tearing out so much more. K.C. knows how to play solitaire and change a tire, but he can never recall a moment of contentment, peace, loneliness, or lust. And however paradoxical it might seem, losing his past wiped out his future as well. The ultimate biological purpose of memory isn’t to recall the past per se, but to prepare for the future by giving us clues about how to act in certain situations. As a result, when K.C. lost his past self, his future self died along with it. He cannot tell you what he’ll do over the next hour, the next day, the next year; he cannot even imagine these things. This loss of his future self doesn’t pain K.C.; he doesn’t suffer or rue his fate. But in some ways that lack of suffering seems sad in and of itself. However unfair, it’s hard not to see him as reduced, diminished.</p>
<p>In our minds, we more or less equate our identities with our memories; our very selves seem the sum total of all we’ve done and felt and seen. That’s why we cling to our memories so hard, even to our detriment, and that’s why diseases like Alzheimer’s, which rob us of memories, seem so cruel. Indeed, most of us wish that we could cling to our memories more securely—they seem the only bulwark against the erosion of the self that K.C. and H.M. experienced. That’s why it’s such a shock to realize that the opposite burden—a hoarding, avaricious memory that <em>cannot</em> forget—can crush people’s identities in the selfsame way.</p>
<p class="space-break">Each morning when Moscow reporter Solomon Shereshevsky got to work, his editor assigned him and the other reporters their daily stories, telling them where to go, what to look for, and whom to interview. Despite the intricacy of the instructions, Shereshevsky never took notes, and according to some accounts he never took notes during interviews, either. He just remembered. Still, Shereshevsky wasn’t a great reporter, and at one morning meeting in the mid-1920s his editor’s fuse went off when he saw Shereshevsky blithely nodding at him, no pencil in hand. He called Shereshevsky out, challenging him to repeat his instructions. Shereshevsky did, verbatim—and then repeated every other word the editor had said that morning, too. When his fellow reporters stared, Shereshevsky’s brow knit in confusion. Didn’t everyone have complete recall? Half amazed, half creeped out, the editor sent Shereshevsky to a local neuroscientist, Aleksandr Luria.</p>
<p>Although a young man then, Luria had already started down the path that would make him one of the most celebrated neuroscientists of the twentieth century. He championed the romantic side of neuroscience, neuroscience that encompassed more than just cells and circuits. He wanted to capture how people actually experienced life, even the messy bits. In doing so, he swam against the current of modern science, which tends to dismiss anecdotal accounts (the plural of anecdote, after all…). But individual case studies have always been crucial to neuroscience: as with the best fiction, it’s the particulars of people’s lives that unveil the universal truths. Indeed, Luria’s book-length case reports have been called “neurological novels,” and he wrote one of his finest on Shereshevsky.</p>
<p>In all their years of collaboration, Luria found “no distinct limits” to Shereshevsky’s memory.<b href="endnotes.xhtml#en0056" id="en0056a"><sup>*</sup></b> The man could recite lists of thirty, fifty, seventy random words or numbers, in order, forward or backward, after hearing or reading them just once. All he needed was three seconds in between each item, to fix it in his hippocampus; after that, it was lapidary. Even more impressive, whatever he memorized stuck with him for years. In one test Luria read the opening stanzas of Dante’s <em>Inferno</em> in Italian, a language Shereshevsky didn’t speak. Fifteen years later, with no rehearsals in between, Shereshevsky recited the lines from memory, with all the proper accents and poetic stress. <em>Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita…</em></p>
<p>You’d think Shereshevsky would have his pick of six-figure jobs, but like many so-called mnemonists, he drifted somewhat loserishly between careers, spending time as a musician, reporter, efficiency consultant, and vaudeville actor (memorizing lines was a snap). Unfit for anything else, he finally landed a job in what was essentially a neurological freak show, touring the country and regurgitating numbers and nonsense words to audiences. The gap between his obvious talents and his lowly status gnawed at Shereshevsky, but to Luria the discrepancy made sense. That’s because Luria traced both his mnemonic prowess and his employment woes to the same root cause—excessive synesthesia.</p>
<p>In Shereshevsky’s mind no real boundary existed between the senses. “Every sound he heard,” Luria reported, “immediately produced an experience of light and color and… taste and touch.” And unlike “normal” synesthetes, whose extra sensations are pretty vanilla (simple odors, single tones), Shereshevsky experienced full-on scenes, full mental stage productions. This became handy when memorizing items. Instead of a violet 2 or chartreuse 6, 2 became “a high-spirited woman,” 6 “a man with a swollen foot.” The number 87 became a stout woman cozying up to a fellow twirling his mustache. The vividness of each item made recalling it later trivial.</p>
<p>To then remember the <em>order</em> of such items, as in a list, Shereshevsky used a trick. He imagined walking along a road in Moscow or in his hometown (whose layout he knew by heart, needless to say) and “depositing” each image at a landmark. Each syllable of the Dante, for instance, summoned up a ballerina or goat or screaming woman, which he’d then plunk down near whatever fence, stone, or tree he happened to be passing at that moment on his mental stroll. To recall the list later, he simply retraced his route, and “picked up” the images he’d left behind. (Professional mnemonists still use this trick today.) The technique backfired only when Shereshevsky, who was rather rigid, did something foolish, like deposit images in dark alleys. In these cases he couldn’t make the image out, and he’d skip the corresponding item on the list. To an outsider this seemed like a lapse, a chink in Shereshevsky’s memory. Luria realized that this was actually less a failure of memory than of perception—Shereshevsky simply couldn’t see the image, nothing more.</p>
<p>Shereshevsky’s memory played other tricks as well. He could increase his pulse rate and even make himself sweat simply by remembering a time when he’d chased down a departing train. He could also (and Luria confirmed this with thermometers) raise the temperature of his right hand by remembering a time he’d held it next to a stove, while simultaneously lowering the temperature of his left hand by remembering what ice felt like. (Shereshevsky could even mentally block out pain in the dentist’s chair.) Somehow his memory could override the “this is just a recollection, it’s not actually happening” signal from the frontal and parietal lobes that should have quelled these somatic reactions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Shereshevsky couldn’t always corral his imagination or confine it to turning mnemonic tricks. When reading a book, synesthetic images would start multiplying inside his head, crowding out the text. A few words into a story, he’d be overwhelmed. Conversations took wrong turns, too. He once asked a gal in an ice cream parlor what flavors they had. The (probably innocent) tone in which she responded “Fruit ice cream,” he said, caused “whole piles of coals, of black cinders, to come bursting out of her mouth. I couldn’t bring myself to buy any.” He sounds insane, or like Hunter S. Thompson at his druggiest. If menus were printed sloppily, Shereshevsky’s meal seemed contaminated by association. He couldn’t eat mayonnaise because a certain sound <em>(zh)</em> in the Russian word for it nauseated him. No wonder he struggled to hold a job—simple instructions would mutate inside his imagination and stagger him.</p>
<p>Even the traveling mnemonist gig eventually became oppressive. After too many years of doing the show, Shereshevsky felt old lists of numbers and words haunting him, cacophonizing inside his skull, elbowing newer memories aside. To rid himself of them, he more or less resorted to voodoo, writing out the lists on paper and burning them. (No luck—the exorcism failed.) Relief came only from suppressing such memories, by training his mind to not acknowledge them. Only dumbing his memory down took the edge off.</p>
<p>Most people who met Shereshevsky considered him dim and timid, a bumbling Prufrock. Indeed, he considered himself pathetic, someone who’d wasted his talent in sideshows. But what else could he have done? With so many memories crowded into his skull—his memory actually stretched back to before his first birthday—his mind became what one observer called “a junk heap of impressions.” As a result he lived in a veritable haze, nearly as befuddled and helpless as H.M. or K.C. A memory that’s too good is just as broken as one that’s no good at all.</p>
<p>To be useful, to enrich our lives, memory cannot simply record the world around us. It needs to filter, to discriminate. In fact, while we joke about a poor memory as a sieve, that’s actually the wrong way around. Sieves let water leak through, but they catch substantial things—they catch what we want to preserve. In the same way, a mind functions best when we let some things, like traumatic memories, go. All normal brains are sieves, and thank goodness for that.</p>
<p class="space-break">However useful, the sieve metaphor isn’t perfect. Human memory doesn’t just filter things. Our memories actually sculpt and rework and—with surprising regularity and slyness—distort what remains behind.</p>
<p>Even neuroscientists, who should know better, fall prey to distortions. Otto Loewi, whose dream about frog hearts helped prove the soup theory of neurotransmission, claimed to have had the dream over Easter weekend in 1920. But the journal in which he published his results, according to its records, received his initial submission a week before Easter that year. A few killjoy historians also think that Loewi didn’t rush from his bed to the lab at 3 a.m., but instead merely wrote out the details of the experiment, step by step, then resumed snoozing. Perhaps Loewi—who loved telling tales—let the demands of narrative drama mold his memory. Similarly, William Sharpe, who harvested the glands of the giant while the family stewed in the front parlor, couldn’t have done so (as he claimed) on New Year’s Day, since the giant died in mid-January. Furthermore, a colleague of Sharpe’s later claimed to have accompanied him on his clandestine errand—and also claimed that they picked through the giant’s innards not right before the funeral but the night before, around 2 a.m. Both men cannot be correct.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Why do memories get twisted like metal girders in a fire and harden into the wrong shape? Neuroscientists disagree on the answer. But one theory gaining momentum says that the very act of remembering something—which you’d think would solidify the details—is what allows mistakes to infiltrate.</p>
<p>When capturing a memory, neurons jury-rig a connection for the short term. They then solder those connections together with special proteins, a process called consolidation. But the brain may use those proteins for more than just capturing memories; the proteins may help retrieve and replay memories, too. Consider: If you play a beep, then shock a mouse, it sure as hell remembers this. Play the tone again, and it freezes in terror, anticipating another shock. Scientists have found, however, that they can make the mouse forget that terror. They do so by injecting a drug into the mouse’s brain just before the second beep, a drug that suppresses the memory-capturing proteins. Shockingly, the <em>next</em> time the tone plays, the mouse keeps on doing mousey things. Without those proteins the memory apparently unravels, and the mouse never fears the beep again. This implies that our brains, when recalling a memory, probably don’t just replay a pristine “master copy” each time. Instead, they might have to re-create and re-record the memory each time through. And if that recording gets disrupted, as it did in the mouse, the memory vanishes. This theory, called <em>re</em>consolidation, argues that there’s little inherent difference between recording first mnemonic impressions and recalling them later.</p>
<p>Now, mice aren’t little humans: humans have richer, fuller memories, and our memories work differently. But not that differently, especially on a molecular level. And if reconsolidation happens in humans—and there’s evidence it does—then having to rerecord a memory each time through probably makes it labile and therefore corruptible. To be sure, we humans don’t often forget events completely, like the mice did. But we do garble details, especially personal details, all the time. As a troubling corollary, the memories that most define us—our tenderest moments, our traumas—could be most prone to distortion, since we reminisce about them most often.</p>
<p>So why do distortions creep in at all? Because we’re human. Subsequent knowledge can always taint a memory: you can never remember your first date quite as fondly if that son of a bitch cheated on you later. So you retroactively retouch things and convince yourself that he mistreated you from the start. We also don’t store memories the way computer hardware does, with each datum in a well-defined location. Human memories live in overlapping neuron circuits that can bleed together over time. (Some observers have compared this to Wikipedia editing, with each neuron able to tweak the master copy.) Perhaps most important, we feel the need to save face or goose our reputations, either by gliding over inconvenient facts or misrepresenting them. Indeed, some scientists argue that the unconscious mind confabulates—makes up plausible stories to mask our true motivations—far more often than we care to admit. Unlike victims of Korsakoff’s syndrome, normal folk don’t confabulate because of memory gaps. But we do tint what we recall and suppress what’s convenient to suppress—until we “remember” what we want to, and can believe that a life-changing dream really did occur on Easter. Memories are memoirs, not autobiographies. And the memories we cherish most may make honest liars of us all.</p>
